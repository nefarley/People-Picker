# People Picker - A PowerApps Project
This powerapp shows how to create a custom people picker. It shows the user's profile picture, and other information from active directory. This can also be used as an add-in for other applications, streamlining the process of allowing users to look-up others within their organization.

Perform a search by the user's name, show the user's information, populate fields with the selected user's information.

# How to Implement...
add a Text Input or Text Label. Using a text input field would allow for the selected user's information to be submitted via form to a sharepoint list or collection.

In the Default section, add a variable name. It'll throw an error message until you create/set the variable in later steps
